# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
  - assets/icons/
  - assets/lang/
  - assets/data/

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
  - family: ProductSans
    fonts:
    - asset: assets/fonts/Product-Sans-Regular.ttf
    - asset: assets/fonts/Product-Sans-Italic.ttf
      style: italic
    - asset: assets/fonts/Product-Sans-Bold.ttf
      weight: 700

  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
  # see https://flutter.io/custom-fonts/#from-packages
